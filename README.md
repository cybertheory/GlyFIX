# GlyFIX
Creating Icons That Represent Common Terms of Service Entries. Certain sercices today aim to summarize TOS and rate the TOS. We aim to 
use these images in software that reads the text and presents pictures to summarize the TOS. Our future software will not depend on 
databases as it aims to be reading the TOS live.

Aims to be incorporated into the Terms of Service; Didn't Read (https://tosdr.org/) project

An extension of and inspired by Aza Raskin's (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Privacy_Icons) Privacy Icons
